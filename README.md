# M2_TouchlessHandwashTimer

This project is about Touchless Handwashing Method, Regular Handwashing and use of hand washing liquid is the only way to remove the bacteria and viruses from our hand. This process is to count the minimum time recommended by the health authorities that we should wash our hands. The Hands should close atleast 5cm to the sensor. The device makes a sound and starts count. After 20 seconds the device makes a sound and wait for the another activation. The device is intended to help us in two ways:It blinks for 20 seconds, to remind us for how long we should wash.It measures the actual time we spent washing our hands, to help us keep up the habit.
